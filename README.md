This project was carried on to observe the life from in Can Gio by analyzing the salinity of the ground due to the sea level rising, which significantly affects the maingrove forest. 


The platform used is Google Earth Engine. To make use of the code, you just need to copy the text file to your Google Earth Engine and run it. 


In this project, we focus on two index: the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI).

This is the salinity map of Can Gio in 2000.

This is in 2020. 

The two images are the result. With the gap of 20 years, the salted area increases dramatically. In addition to the global warming, which causes rise in sea level, the land are now in the state of being salted seriouly.
